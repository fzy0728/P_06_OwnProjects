SIGIR 2013 has accepted 85 Short Papers. 
Short Papers offer researchers an opportunity to present significant work in progress or research that is best communicated in an interactive or graphical format. Each submission accepted for SIGIR 2013 will be presented in a poster format, in order to provide researchers with an opportunity to obtain direct feedback about their work from a wide audience during the poster session.

Poster presentations of SIGIR Short Papers will take place on Monday afternoon and Tuesday afternoon as part of the main scientific programme, not on Monday evening as in previous years. Note that half of the posters will be presented on Monday and half on Tuesday! Both sessions will take place in the Exam Hall, TCD.
